        <h2>Haskell Web App Module Name Conventions</h2>

<p>by <em>Daniel Patterson</em> on <strong>DRAFT</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A note: I don’t write single-page apps. Perhaps some of this translates to people who do, but I don’t know. When I say “web app”, I mean server-rendered html pages that have forms and buttons and store their state on the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different people have different preferences for how to organize code in their applications. One of the really cool things about most Haskell web frameworks is they let you organize your code however you want (even the exceptions generally only have a few things they require).</p>
<p>This is neat because it means projects can be scaled down (so a tiny project might be able to be a single file) and that there generally isn’t any magic: code comes from modules because you import them, not because some framework magically found it in a particular path (I’m looking at you Rails).</p>
<p>The downside to this, of course, is that figuring out best practices is up to individual developers or teams (and I’ve tried many options, some of which worked out less well than others). Different people have different tastes, but after building web apps in Haskell for almost 11 years now (first for fun, then for work, now for fun again), this is the system for arranging modules that I’ve found that seems to work quite well. Note that this was developed first using the <a href="http://snapframework.com/">Snap</a> web framework and then more recently the <a href="http://fnhaskell.com/">Fn</a> framework that I co-wrote, but I’ve also used <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty">Scotty</a> and <a href="https://haskell-servant.github.io/">Servant</a> and I think the advice would work equally well for them.</p>
<h3 id="pure-type-modules">1. Pure type modules</h3>
<p>For each record, which in a database backed application, will usually correspond to a table, define a separate module. I would use <code>Types.Person</code> if <code>Person</code> were the name of the type. This should contain the record, which, contrary to many examples, should <em>not</em> have prefixed field names (the prefix, where necessary, is already present in the module name!): just name the fields the most natural names, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>data Person = Person { id :: Int, firstName :: Text } deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>This module should also include any type class instances for <code>Person</code> (e.g., serialization), and related types. For example, if there is a data type that is a field within the record (e.g., you might have a <code>role</code> field that has a fixed number of options; in the database it is represented textually, but it shouldn’t be in your application), define it within the <code>Types.Person</code> module rather than giving it it’s own module, unless it’s useful to other modules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A note about casing: I don’t think this is controversial, but match what is most natural in whatever domain the name appears in. So field names in Haskell should be camelCase, in the database should be snake_case, and in frontend templates I hyphenate-them. Transforming between these can be automated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having pure modules to define types is really helpful to avoid module circularity; most of the time the issue is that you’ll end up needing to allow more core application types refer to specific data for the application (e.g., in <a href="http://fnhaskell.com/">Fn</a> web handlers pass around a “context” that contains database connections, request information, etc. It necessarily is used many places, but you may also want it to be able to contain information about a logged in user. By having the types on their own, it’s much easier to pull those types into the definition of core data types like the “context”).</p>
<h3 id="state-modules-for-manipulating-state-with-consistent-names">2. State modules for manipulating state with consistent names</h3>
<p>There are tons of different libraries for dealing with databases, but from the perspective of module organization, each module <code>Types.Person</code> should be matched with <code>State.Person</code>, and just like the field names in the <code>Person</code> record shouldn’t have any prefix or suffix, neither should functions in the <code>State.Person</code> module. So, for example, I’ll usually have <code>get</code>, <code>create</code>, and <code>delete</code> as functions, and perhaps <code>getByFoo</code> or <code>deleteByBar</code>. The reason for this is the <code>State.Person</code> module is expected to always be imported qualified (it ends up looking more uniform anyway).</p>
<h3 id="qualify-modules-that-are-for-a-different-part-of-the-application">3. Qualify modules that are for a different part of the application</h3>
<p>In general, organizing the application around the records (i.e., database tables) works pretty well. It won’t be 100% (and it doesn’t matter, because Haskell doesn’t care), but usually I’ll have a <code>Handler.Person</code> module to go along with the <code>Types.Person</code>, which would contain web code to handle routing, form parsing and various high level glue, and <code>State.Person</code> which has state manipulation (database queries, business logic, etc).</p>
<p>Within <code>State.Person</code>, import <code>Types.Person</code> unqualified. There should be no conflicts. From <code>Handler.Person</code>, <code>Types.Person</code> should be imported unqualified as well. That way you can use the type <code>Person</code> unqualified. <code>State.Person</code> should be imported qualified as <code>State</code>. Thus to look up a person by id we might invoke <code>State.get</code>.</p>
<p>If we needed to access a <code>Document</code> record, we import <code>Types.Document</code> qualified as <code>Document</code> and <code>State.Document</code> fully qualified. There is a little redundancy in the type/constructor name (if you have to write <code>Document.Document</code> and it bothers you, you can important <code>Document(Document)</code> separately), but the former means you can have <code>Document.createdAt</code> as the record field for when the document was created and <code>createdAt</code> for when a <code>Person</code> was created. Similarly, <code>State.Document.get</code> would look up a <code>Document</code> by id. This of course is done symmetrically when you are working within <code>Handler.Document</code> (assuming it existed).</p>
<p>Other <code>Handler</code> modules should also be imported fully qualified. It’s less common to need this, but it comes up, and the clarity of the full qualification is great. If you end up splitting modules in more fine grained ways than these three (and sometimes I have, e.g., splitting out form validation, or the code that is used in templates), the same general principles apply: within the <code>Category1.X</code> module, any <code>Category2.X</code> is imported qualified as <code>Category2</code> (unless <code>Category2</code> is <code>Types</code> in which case it’s imported unqualified), and <code>Category3.Y</code> is imported fully qualified.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Although it wasn’t the original intention (just making code more understandable was), I’ve realized this naming scheme really matches the mantra that name length should match name locality (i.e., the further from definition, the longer the name should be), writ large. Functions that are highly relevant to a particular module have short names (since they are unqualified or minimally qualified), whereas ones from very different parts of the application have longer names that tell more about what they are for. It also helps to serve as a reminder when things start to get tangled, as you end up using more fully qualified functions (and that’s a sign that maybe some refactoring is needed).</p>
