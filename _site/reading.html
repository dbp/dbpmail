        <h2 id="things-ive-read">Things I’ve read</h2>
<p>This is a chronological list of some things I’ve been reading, with brief notes, reflections, impressions, etc. The main criteria for inclusion are: non-triviality (usually this means some length, but not always), and interest (so an uninteresting paper or book doesn’t merit inclusion).</p>
<p>Often, clusters of papers are related. This is due to the wonderful experience of reading research papers, where one paper references another, so I start reading that instead, but the second paper is actually based on a third, etc. Finding papers like this (vs. searching online) is also great because it naturally selects papers that were well written and/or influential.</p>

<li><em>FizzBuzz in Haskell by Embedding a Domain-Specific Language</em>. Maciej Pirog. 2014. <a href="http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/fizzbuzz.pdf">PDF</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>_A fun short paper about solving the classic interview question using languages / interpreters as a way of approaching the problem. The “trick” to the result is continuations, in order to implement control flow in the DSL.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Scrap Your Boilerplate: A Practical Design Pattern for Generic Programming</em>. Ralf Lammel, Simon Peyton Jones. 2003. <a href="http://www.ldpreload.com/p/syb/hmap.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Presenting patterns for generic traversal and modifications of data structures where you only have to write the cases you care about. Written for an audience of normal Haskell programmers.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><em>Finally Tagless, Partially Evaluated: Tagless Staged Interpreters for Simpler Typed Languages</em>. J Carette, O Kiselyov, CC Shan. 2007. <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/JFP.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Writing embedded typed languages inside typed languages without tags or interpretation (the primary idea is to use functions instead of data to represent terms of the language). Really neat presentation, as it uses both OCaml and Haskell with real, working examples. The language syntaxes are module signatures in the former, and type class instances in the latter. Then the semantics are modules or class instances respectively.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><em>Fun with Type Functions</em>. Oleg Kiselyov, Ken Shan, and Simon Peyton Jones. 2010. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/assoc-types/fun-with-type-funs/typefun.pdf">PDF</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A tutorial style introduction to type level functions, which are implemented in terms of type synonym families. One of the main motivations for this is parametrizing type classes over types in a more straightforwardly functional way (as contrasted with functional dependencies). Very readable.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><em>Computing at school in the UK: from guerrilla to gorillaS</em>. Simon Peyton Jones, Simon Humphreys, Bill Mitchell. 2013. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/cas/ComputingAtSchoolCACM.pdf">PDF</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This was an interesting mix of motivation for why teaching computer science as a core science (along with Physics, Chemistry, and Biology) starting in primary schoool is important, and also how the group “Computing at School” in the UK has essentially succeeded at doing this.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><em>Towards a Declarative Web</em>. (a.k.a. Haste Report). Anton Ekblad. 2012. <a href="http://ekblad.cc/hastereport.pdf">PDF</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Compilation of Haskell to Javascript. Not a super new idea, but seems to get pretty good performance out of a relatively minimal implementation. And, people seem to be using it for real work, which is definitely neat!</em></p>
