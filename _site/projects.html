<ul>
<li><h3 id="fn---a-functional-web-framework.">Fn - A functional web framework.</h3>
<p>Fn is a web framework written in the functional language Haskell, with the explicit goal of writing code in a more functional style - handlers to web requests are normal functions with arguments and return types (rather than monadic actions), and there are no monad transformers. In many ways it makes writing web code more like writing plain Haskell. <a href="https:/github.com/positiondev/fn">github.com/positiondev/fn</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="hworker---a-reliable-at-least-once-job-processor.">Hworker - A reliable at-least-once job processor.</h3>
<p>Hworker is a Redis-backed background job processor written in Haskell. It handles running jobs that, for various reasons (usually that they take a while to complete), have to run in the background (sending email is a common example). It has a strong focus on reliability, in that once a job has been queued, it is guaranteed to run at least once. <a href="https://github.com/dbp/hworker">github.com/dbp/hworker</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="rivet---a-migration-tool.">Rivet - A migration tool.</h3>
<p>Rivet is the beginning of a database migration tool for Haskell, that allows you to both write SQL migrations, but also ones that have to run arbitrary Haskell code. It’s pretty early, but is used in various projects. <a href="https://github.com/dbp/rivet">github.com/dbp/rivet</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="lexical-style-sheets-lss">Lexical Style Sheets (LSS)</h3>
<p>LSS is an experiment in making CSS more maintainable. The main goal is that all styling is statically (or lexically) scoped to a specific part of the DOM tree, by attaching groups of styles to specific nodes. These groups are named and can be parametrized (so, for example, if you have a few different menus that share most styling in common, this is supported), and you can also define constants in your <code>.lss</code> files. It’s available to be used at <a href="https://github.com/dbp/lss">github.com/dbp/lss</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="pyret-programming-language">Pyret Programming Language</h3>
<p>A research / teaching language being developed by a small team at Brown University. It’s a scripting language that tries to learn from the best features that scripting languages have, but it also has serious functional roots and optional types. <a href="http://www.pyret.org">pyret.org</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="position-sites">Position Sites</h3>
<p>A platform for building dynamic websites that imposes no constraints on the shape of information you will be using. It is still pretty new, but is being used by clients currently, and the source is available at <a href="https://github.com/dbp/positionsites">github.com/dbp/positionsites</a>. Descriptions of how some of it works are available at <a href="http://positionsites.com/docs">positionsites.com/docs</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="analyze">Analyze</h3>
<p>A lightweight web based analytics and error reporting platform, used with clients of <a href="http://positionstudios.com">Position Studios</a>. It is open source, available at <a href="http://github.com/dbp/analyze">github.com/dbp/analyze</a>.</p></li>

<!-- * ### Democracy Now! Player -->
<!--   A simple player that automatically plays the current days show of -->
<!--   the news program [Democracy Now!](http://democracynow.org). It -->
<!--   remembers where you are automatically, and can synchronize that -->
<!--   across devices (mobile, desktop, etc) through a lightweight -->
<!--   mechanism. Old version is available at -->
<!--   [github.com/dbp/dnplayer](https://github.com/dbp/dnplayer), and the -->
<!--   backend of a new, as-yet unreleased mobile version is available at -->
<!--   [github.com/dbp/dnplayer_server](https://github.com/dbp/dnplayer_server). -->
<ul>
<li><h3 id="rustle">Rustle</h3>
An api search for the <a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> programming language that allows you to search for core functions by type (or by name). This is pretty outdated at this point, but can be read about at <a href="http://github.com/dbp/rustle">github.com/dbp/rustle</a>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- * ### WeShift -->
<!--   A webapp for workplaces that allows workers to keep track of hours and changes to their shifts, switch with other people, and track timesheets for discrepencies. It's intended to be useable with or without participation by management. Open to anyone who wants to use it at [weshift.org](http://weshift.org), or anyone who wants to hack on it at [hub.darcs.net/position/weshift](http://hub.darcs.net/position/weshift). -->
<!-- * ### Housetab -->
<!--   A webapp for expense tracking among groups of people. Based on the idea that certain people pay for things, but groups of people might share the purchase (whether it be rent, food, etc). Can cope with different people at different percentages of sharing, and other stuff too. Online at [housetab.org](http://housetab.org), source at [darcsden.com/position/housetab](http://darcsden.com/position/housetab). -->
