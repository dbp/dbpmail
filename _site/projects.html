<li><h3>Rivet - A Project Tool For Snap</h3>
<p>Rivet is a tool to make doing web development with the Haskell web framework Snap easier. If you’re familiar with the Ruby on Rails ecosystem, it combines features from the ‘rails’ and ‘rake’ programs. It does database migrations, smart recompilation, can generate models, and is extensible both on a project-based, ad-hoc way, and through a libraries. <a href="https://github.com/dbp/rivet">github.com/dbp/rivet</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3>Lexical Style Sheets (LSS)</h3>
<p>LSS is an experiment in making CSS more maintainable. The main goal is that all styling is statically (or lexically) scoped to a specific part of the DOM tree, by attaching groups of styles to specific nodes. These groups are named and can be parametrized (so, for example, if you have a few different menus that share most styling in common, this is supported), and you can also define constants in your <code>.lss</code> files. It’s available to be used at <a href="https://github.com/dbp/lss">github.com/dbp/lss</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3>Pyret Programming Language</h3>
<p>A research / teaching language being developed by a small team at Brown University. It’s a scripting language that tries to learn from the best features that scripting languages have, but it also has serious functional roots and optional types. <a href="http://www.pyret.org">pyret.org</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3>Position Sites</h3>
<p>A platform for building dynamic websites that imposes no constraints on the shape of information you will be using. It is still pretty new, but is being used by clients currently, and the source is available at <a href="https://github.com/dbp/positionsites">github.com/dbp/positionsites</a>. Descriptions of how some of it works are available at <a href="http://positionsites.com/docs">positionsites.com/docs</a>.</p></li>
<li><h3>Analyze</h3>
<p>A lightweight web based analytics and error reporting platform, used with clients of <a href="http://positionstudios.com">Position Studios</a>. It is open source, available at <a href="http://github.com/dbp/analyze">github.com/dbp/analyze</a>.</p></li>
