<p>From <a href="http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/storer/ozracer_rv/index.htm">these plans</a> (a $20 download).</p>
<h3 id="summary-and-some-notes">Summary and some notes</h3>
<p>There wasn’t much information out there about this build, even though it seems like a lot of people have made them. In particular, I had no idea how long I should expect it to take (and I underestimated how long it would take – the only number I saw was 10 days, which perhaps a professional, or someone with a helper, could do, but not me!). So this page is an attempt to give more information that might be useful to someone taking on this project. My current estimate (based on thinking that I may be 2/3rds done) is that, for a single person who is new to boat building and has only done basic carpentry, this project could be completed in <strong>~120 hours</strong> (or about 3 weeks full-time) (I think the hours are probably right, though the weeks might be a little off, as there are lots of things that have to dry, and I may be underestimating the delays needed in the remaining parts that I haven’t done yet).</p>
<p>Also, the plans are pretty detailed, but they aren’t perfect – there are places where they are incomplete, or misleading (e.g., they suggest gluing in the mast step at two different places in the plans – I chose the first one arbitrarily!) So read everything and try to understand how things fit together – it’s not a matter of just following the instructions in order. However, I am confident that they include enough information that a complete novice (like me) can end up with a boat!</p>
<p>Another unclear part is when you should be epoxying things! In the appendix, the author says that they strongly prefer coating surfaces at the point that they are getting glued to other things, but then the instructions (and images) don’t seem to do that. Some surfaces really should be done that way, because then they will become in internal places, but others may be better to wait (I realize now, perhaps the inside of sealed compartments need not have been coated at all! Assuming no leaks, they should never see water, and it would have saved time and weight to not coat them). I ended up coating most everything (on both sides) before assembly, somewhat ignoring the advice that places where pieces will later get attached should get masked off (confusingly, one of the main sources of information, aside from the plans, is this site: <a href="http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html" class="uri">http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html</a>, which suggests pre-coating the <em>entire</em> plywood panels. This might have actually been a much better plan, but clearly contradicts the idea that you shouldn’t pre-coat areas that will get glued. It’s also probably somewhat wasteful, as even scrap parts get coated, and it may make things harder to cut, as epoxy makes the wood a lot stronger). I then sanded the panels before they got glued to other parts, and hopefully it’s all strong enough!</p>
<h3 id="tools-used-in-order-of-frequency">Tools Used (in order of frequency):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drill</li>
<li>Jig Saw</li>
<li>Belt Sander</li>
<li>Orbital Sander</li>
<li>Router</li>
<li>Table saw – to rip lumber to the right dimensions (done all at once the first day, as I don’t own one)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I did not use a hand plane, even though it’s one of the primary tools in the plans. I bought one, but it was crappy and the sharpening guide I bought didn’t fit it, and I wasn’t able to sharpen it free-hand, and eventually gave up and used the jig saw / belt sander instead (cutting down to close, using sander for the rest), with the exception of narrowing the mast pieces which I used the router for.</p>

<p>This was quite a bit more than I was expecting (which, based on things I had read, made me think it’d be about $500). Part of that is probably that I got marine paint, which is expensive, vs. regular outdoor house paint (which probably would have been fine, and probably would have saved ~$80), but also not thinking about all the disposable stuff (brushes, rollers, drop cloths, gloves) which, on it’s own isn’t expensive, but adds up. Finally, the rigging stuff, deck hatches, and rudder hardware is not cheap ($51 for rope &amp; blocks, $35 for rudder stuff, $20 for two 6&quot; hatches)! Those things account for about $300, which combined with probably paying more for lumber than strictly necessary (I got high quality 5/4ths stuff for the foils, which was not cheap, and I probably could have just gotten more 2x4s and ripped them. The plywood was just under $100, and there really wasn’t that much other lumber necessary) and a lot of miscellaneous things (like $8.65 for seam tape for the sail, $5 for high quality thread, etc) account for the “extra”.</p>

<h3 id="progress-at-this-point">Progress at this point</h3>
<p>Thus far, I’ve built / painted the main hull, and started on the foils (gluing together the blanks, make part of jig for shaping them) and the mast (scarfing them to full length, shaping the narrow sides). Probably the rest can be done in about five more days (i.e., 40 more hours) – we’ll see when I have more time!</p>
<h3 id="photos-of-progress">Photos of progress</h3>
<img src="../static/boat/boat-1.jpg" /> Getting all the lumber, post stripping it with a table saw my dad had. Without access to a table saw and someone who knows how to use it, I don’t think this project would be possible – the dimensions of lumber needed are <em>not</em> things that are available standard. And, even if they were, they would probably be so much more expensive. For example, I got 12&quot; wide pine planks that were then ripped to get the 3/4&quot; by 3/4&quot; strips, the 3/4&quot; by 1 3/4“, etc.

<p><img src="../static/boat/boat-4.jpg" /> Marking side panels (first mistake is present in this photo – third and possibly fourth clamp are not in the right place, and the flexible wood batten was so flexible that I was able to make the shape. The bottom is supposed to be a smooth curve! All other panels marked to match this one, replicating the mistake.)</p>
