## Building the OzRacer RV

From [these plans](http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/storer/ozracer_rv/index.htm) (a $20 download).

### Summary and some notes

There wasn't much information out there about this build, even though it seems
like a lot of people have made them. In particular, I had no idea how long I
should expect it to take (and I underestimated how long it would take -- the
only number I saw was 10 days, which perhaps a professional, or someone with a
helper, could do, but not me!). So this page is an attempt to give more
information that might be useful to someone taking on this project. My current
estimate (based on thinking that I may be 2/3rds done) is that, for a single
person who is new to boat building and has only done basic carpentry, this
project could be completed in **~120 hours** (or about 3 weeks full-time) (I
think the hours are probably right, though the weeks might be a little off, as
there are lots of things that have to dry, and I may be underestimating the
delays needed in the remaining parts that I haven't done yet).

Also, the plans are pretty detailed, but they aren't perfect -- there are places
where they are incomplete, or misleading (e.g., they suggest gluing in the mast
step at two different places in the plans -- I chose the first one arbitrarily!)
So read everything and try to understand how things fit together -- it's not a
matter of just following the instructions in order. However, I am confident that
they include enough information that a complete novice (like me) can end up with
a boat!

Another unclear part is when you should be epoxying things! In the appendix, the
author says that they strongly prefer coating surfaces at the point that they
are getting glued to other things, but then the instructions (and images) don't
seem to do that. Some surfaces really should be done that way, because then they
will become in internal places, but others may be better to wait (I realize now,
perhaps the inside of sealed compartments need not have been coated at all!
Assuming no leaks, they should never see water, and it would have saved time and
weight to not coat them). I ended up coating most everything (on both sides)
before assembly, somewhat ignoring the advice that places where pieces will
later get attached should get masked off (confusingly, one of the main sources
of information, aside from the plans, is this
site:
[http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html](http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html),
which suggests pre-coating the _entire_ plywood panels. This might have actually
been a much better plan, but clearly contradicts the idea that you shouldn't
pre-coat areas that will get glued. It's also probably somewhat wasteful, as
even scrap parts get coated, and it may make things harder to cut, as epoxy
makes the wood a lot stronger). I then sanded the panels before they got glued to other parts, and hopefully it's all strong enough!


### Tools Used (in order of frequency):

- Drill
- Jig Saw
- Belt Sander
- Orbital Sander
- Router
- Table saw -- to rip lumber to the right dimensions (done all at once the first
  day, as I don't own one)

Note: I did not use a hand plane, even though it's one of the primary tools in
the plans. I bought one, but it was crappy and the sharpening guide I bought
didn't fit it, and I wasn't able to sharpen it free-hand, and eventually gave up
and used the jig saw / belt sander instead (cutting down to close, using sander
for the rest), with the exception of narrowing the mast pieces which I used the
router for.

### Cost

    Amount                    Description
----------  -------           ------
$20         Duckworks         Plans
$368.65     Duckworks         Fiberglass tape, cloth, wood flour, sail tape, thread, rigging hardware, 3 gallons of marinepoxy, two 6" deck plates (and over $50 shipping!)
$216.74     Local lumberyard  Plywood (four 1/4" plywood sheets) and all lumber
$97.34      Amazon            Topside marine primer, paint (white & red), non-stick additive
$55         Amazon            Wood glue, grommets, painters tape, duct tape, heavy duty needles, 2" screws, 3/4" screws.
~$150       Home depot        Plastic drop cloth, disposable gloves, sand paper (belt & discs), rollers (pant & adhesive), brushes, tack cloth, silicone glue, etc. Some of these weren't used up.
$38.01      Tarpsnow.com      16'x20' white tarp
$42.09      Duckworks         Rudder hardware (from Duckworks, RL-390-GW, fasteners, shipping)
Total:       **$987.83**

This was quite a bit more than I was expecting (which, based on things I had
read, made me think it'd be about $500). Part of that is probably that I got
marine paint, which is expensive, vs. regular outdoor house paint (which
probably would have been fine, and probably would have saved ~$80), but also not
thinking about all the disposable stuff (brushes, rollers, drop cloths, gloves)
which, on it's own isn't expensive, but adds up. Finally, the rigging stuff,
deck hatches, and rudder hardware is not cheap ($51 for rope & blocks, $35 for
rudder stuff, $20 for two 6" hatches)! Those things account for about $300,
which combined with probably paying more for lumber than strictly necessary (I
got high quality 5/4ths stuff for the foils, which was not cheap, and I probably
could have just gotten more 2x4s and ripped them. The plywood was just under
$100, and there really wasn't that much other lumber necessary) and a lot of
miscellaneous things (like $8.65 for seam tape for the sail, $5 for high quality
thread, etc) account for the "extra".

### Progress at this point

Thus far, I've built / painted the main hull, and started on the foils (gluing
together the blanks, make part of jig for shaping them) and the mast (scarfing
them to full length, shaping the narrow sides). Probably the rest can be done in
about five more days (i.e., 40 more hours) -- we'll see when I have more time!

### Photos of progress

![](/static/boat/boat-1.jpg) Getting all the lumber, post stripping it with a
table saw my dad had. Without access to a table saw and someone who knows how to
use it, I don't think this project would be possible -- the dimensions of lumber
needed are _not_ things that are available standard. And, even if they were,
they would probably be so much more expensive. For example, I got 12" wide pine
planks that were then ripped to get the 3/4" by 3/4" strips, the 3/4" by 1 3/4",
etc.

![](/static/boat/boat-4.jpg) Marking side panels (first mistake is present in
this photo -- third and possibly fourth clamp are not in the right place, and
the flexible wood batten was so flexible that I was able to make the shape. The
bottom is supposed to be a smooth curve! All other panels marked to match this
one, replicating the mistake.)

![](/static/boat/boat-5.jpg) Making more side panels.

![](/static/boat/boat-6.jpg) Sanding all side panels to be identical. This was
supposed to be done with a plane, but I couldn't get that to work. The sander
worked though!

![](/static/boat/boat-7.jpg) Cutting forward bulkhead.

![](/static/boat/boat-8.jpg) Epoxying rear transom & forward bulkhead.

![](/static/boat/boat-9.jpg) Epoxying side panels, attaching framing.

![](/static/boat/boat-10.jpg) Sanding panels, transoms, bulkhead.

![](/static/boat/boat-11.jpg) Boat is 3D! No bottom yet though.

![](/static/boat/boat-12.jpg) After long and hard day, added mast step /
partner, epoxied bottom and with help of dad (**this would not have been
possible alone, as we had to wrench it into shape and then put in screws to hold
it**), attached bottom (involving a bit of work to get the boat square, and then
a lot more work to get the bottom to attach to the sides due to the mistake
shaping the bottom; had to add more trim and screw through the bottom to get it
to pull up to side panels.)

![](/static/boat/boat-13.jpg) Dry fitting deck.

![](/static/boat/boat-14.jpg) Epoxying bottom of deck.

![](/static/boat/boat-15.jpg) Adding fiberglass tape to seams, epoxying bottom
of boat.

![](/static/boat/boat-16.jpg) Scarfing mast pieces together and cutting to
length. (Though, not pictured here I narrowed them with a router, and messed up
the narrowest part, so I think I'm going to switch to a lug sail which requires
shorter masts, and thus I can cut off the mistake!)

![](/static/boat/boat-17.jpg) Priming bottom of boat.

![](/static/boat/boat-18.jpg) Painted & flipped the boat (it's gotten heavy!
Problem with getting plywood from a local lumberyard is that thinnest they had
was 1/4", and I'm sure it's not the lightest stuff!)

![](/static/boat/boat-19.jpg) Moved outside to paint top.

![](/static/boat/boat-20.jpg) Primed top and inside.

![](/static/boat/boat-21.jpg) Painted top and inside.

![](/static/boat/boat-22.jpg) Some really crappy paddles made out of scrap ply,
extra 3/4" square with some epoxy added and fiberglass tape wrapped around
handle (though I was lazy and only did a single coat of epoxy, so fiberglass
tape is still very present. It also hadn't fully dried when we took it out the
next day, so I wrapped duct tape around the handle and halfway down the shaft,
so it wouldn't feel sticky!)

![](/static/boat/boat-23.jpg) Testing the hull out. Found a minor leak in the
left side tank (I haven't cut the leeboard slot yet, so it isn't that).
