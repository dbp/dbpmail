## Building the OzRacer RV

From [these plans](http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/storer/ozracer_rv/index.htm).

Tools Used (in order of frequency):

- Drill
- Jig Saw
- Belt Sander
- Orbital Sander
- Router

Note: I did not use a hand plane. I bought one, but it was crappy and the
sharpening guide I bought didn't fit it, so I wasn't able to sharpen it, and
eventually gave up and used the jig saw / belt sander instead (cutting down to
close, using sander for the rest), with the exception of narrowing the mast pieces which I used the router for.

Cost: TBD, but roughly $500.

Progress:

In ten full days, I built / painted the main hull, and start on the
foils (gluing together the blanks, make part of jig for shaping them) and the
mast (scarfing them to full length, shaping the narrow sides). Probably the rest
could be done in about five days. As a single person, I'm not sure if it would
be possible to do it all that much quicker, especially because all the waiting
for glue to dry that is involved.

Work log:

- **8/3 (8h)** 10am-6pm epoxy and attach frames to bulkheads and sides 
- **8/4 (5.5h)** 11:30am-5pm epoxying reverse sides, building & epoxying inside of leeboard case
- **8/6 (2h)** 1:45pm-3:45 sand sides/bulkheads, glue together 
- **8/7 (7.75h)** 8:30am-4:15pm mast partner and step

table saw my dad had.

![](/static/boat/boat-4.jpg) Marking side panels (first mistake is present in this photo -- third and possibly fourth clamp are not in the right place, and the flexible wood batten was so flexible that I was able to make the shape. The bottom is supposed to be a smooth curve! All other panels marked to match this one, replicating the mistake.)

![](/static/boat/boat-11.jpg) Boat is 3D! No bottom yet though.

![](/static/boat/boat-12.jpg) After long and hard day, added mast step / partner, epoxied bottom and with help of dad, attached bottom (involving a bit of work to get the boat square, and then a lot more work to get the bottom to attach to the sides due to the mistake shaping the bottom; had to add more trim and screw through the bottom to get it to pull up to side panels.)

![](/static/boat/boat-13.jpg) Dry fitting deck.

![](/static/boat/boat-14.jpg) Epoxying bottom of deck.

![](/static/boat/boat-15.jpg) Adding fiberglass tape to seams, epoxying bottom
of boat.

![](/static/boat/boat-16.jpg) Scarfing mast pieces together and cutting to
length. (Though, not pictured here I narrowed them with a router, and messed up
the narrowest part, so I think I'm going to switch to a lug sail which requires
shorter masts, and thus I can cut off the mistake!)

![](/static/boat/boat-17.jpg) Priming bottom of boat.

![](/static/boat/boat-18.jpg) Painted & flipped the boat (it's gotten heavy!
Problem with getting plywood from a local lumberyard is that thinnest they had
was 1/4", and I'm sure it's not the lightest stuff!)

![](/static/boat/boat-19.jpg) Moved outside to paint top.

![](/static/boat/boat-20.jpg) Primed top and inside.

![](/static/boat/boat-21.jpg) Painted top and inside.

![](/static/boat/boat-22.jpg) Some really crappy paddles made out of scrap ply,
extra 3/4" square with some epoxy added and fiberglass tape wrapped around
handle (though I was lazy and only did a single coat of epoxy, so fiberglass
tape is still very present. It also hadn't fully dried when we took it out the
next day, so I wrapped duct tape around the handle and halfway down the shaft,
so it wouldn't feel sticky!)
