## Projects

* ### Pyret Programming Language
  A research / teaching language being developed by a small team at Brown University. It's a scripting language that tries to learn from the best features that scripting languages have, but it also has serious functional roots (and wants to have types...). It's changing rapidly (it _is_ a research project), but you can learn more about it and try it out at [pyret.org](http://www.pyret.org).


* ### Position Sites
  A nacent platform for building dynamic websites that imposes no constraints on the shape of information you will be using. It is still pretty early, and not available to be tried (though the source is available at [github.com/dbp/positionsites](https://github.com/dbp/positionsites)). Descriptions of how some of it works are available at [positionsites.com/docs](http://positionsites.com/docs).


* ### Analyze
  A lightweight web based analytics and error reporting platform, used with clients of [Position Studios](http://positionstudios.com). It is open source, available at [github.com/dbp/analyze](http://github.com/dbp/analyze).


* ### Democracy Now! Player
  A simple player that automatically plays the current days show of the news program [Democracy Now!](http://democracynow.org). It remembers where you are automatically, and can synchronize that across devices (mobile, desktop, etc) through a lightweight mechanism. Try it out online at [lab.dbpmail.net/dn](http://lab.dbpmail.net/dn/), and check out the source / contribute patches at [github.com/dbp/dnplayer](https://github.com/dbp/dnplayer). Note: it is currently broken by iOS 7's treatment of video on web pages (an iPhone version is a work in progress).


* ### Rustle
  An api search for the [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) programming language that allows you to search for core functions by type (or by name). This is pretty outdated (and Rust is moving so quickly), but can be   read about at [github.com/dbp/rustle](http://github.com/dbp/rustle).


* ### WeShift
  A webapp for workplaces that allows workers to keep track of hours and changes to their shifts, switch with other people, and track timesheets for discrepencies. It's intended to be useable with or without participation by management. Open to anyone who wants to use it at [weshift.org](http://weshift.org), or anyone who wants to hack on it at [hub.darcs.net/position/weshift](http://hub.darcs.net/position/weshift).

* ### Housetab
  A webapp for expense tracking among groups of people. Based on the idea that certain people pay for things, but groups of people might share the purchase (whether it be rent, food, etc). Can cope with different people at different percentages of sharing, and other stuff too. Online at [housetab.org](http://housetab.org), source at [darcsden.com/position/housetab](http://darcsden.com/position/housetab).
