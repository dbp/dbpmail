## Daniel Patterson

I'm currently part of a small worker-owned software contracting company, [Position Development](http://positiondev.com), that I helped start in 2014. As of September 2016, I'll be a graduate student at [Northeastern University](http://www.ccs.neu.edu) studying under [Amal Ahmed](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/). I did math and computer science undergrad at <a href="http://cs.brown.edu">Brown University</a>. I'm interested in programming languages, education, and leftist politics. This is my personal website, with writing, code and contact information.

## Contact

The easiest way to get in touch is via email: <a href="mailto:dbp@dbpmail.net">dbp@dbpmail.net</a>. Note that if you have another email address for me, it will probably work as well. I'm currently located in Brooklyn, NY.
