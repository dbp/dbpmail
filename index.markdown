## Daniel Patterson

I studied math and computer science at <a href="http://cs.brown.edu">Brown University</a>. I'm interested in algorithms, programming languages, and where they intersect with education. This is my personal website, with writing, reading, code, photos and contact information.

## Contact

The easiest way to get in touch is via email: <a href="mailto:dbp@dbpmail.net">dbp@dbpmail.net</a>. Note that if you have another email address for me, it will probably work as well. I'm currently located in New York, NY.
